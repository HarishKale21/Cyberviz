CyberViz: Live Cyber Attack Visualization Dashboard
A preview of the CyberViz live dashboard in action.

ðŸ“œ Description
CyberViz is a dynamic and interactive web dashboard that provides a real-time visualization of simulated global cyber attacks. It serves not only as a visual tool but also as an educational platform, offering insights into different types of cyber threats and real-world case studies of cybercrime filed under the Indian IT Act.

The project is built with a modern, professional, high-tech aesthetic, focusing on a clean user interface, smooth navigation, and engaging data representation.

âœ¨ Key Features
Live World Map: A dynamic map visualizes simulated cyber attacks in real-time, showing their origin and destination.

Real-Time Simulation: Generates new attacks (DDoS, Malware, Phishing) every few seconds to create a live-monitoring experience.

Interactive Dashboard:

Displays live statistics for Total Attacks and the Top Target Country.

Features a live-updating bar chart showing the Top 5 most attacked countries.

Advanced Filtering: Users can filter the attacks being displayed on the map by their type (DDoS, Malware, Phishing).

Educational Platform:

Attack Information: Detailed pop-ups explaining what different cyber attacks are and how they work.

Indian Case Studies: An in-depth look at real-world cybercrime cases, presenting findings and actions taken under the Indian IT Act.

Professional UI/UX:

A sleek, dark-themed interface inspired by high-tech security dashboards.

A sticky navigation bar for smooth, single-page scrolling.

An animated particle background for a futuristic feel.

Uses a combination of Orbitron and Roboto fonts for a balance between style and readability.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Libraries:

amCharts 4: For creating the interactive world map and bar chart.

Particles.js: For the animated network background.

Google Fonts: For the 'Orbitron' and 'Roboto' typefaces.

ðŸš€ How to Run Locally
No complex setup or installation is required! This project uses only front-end technologies.

Clone the repository (or download the files to a folder):

git clone (https://github.com/HarishKale21/Cyberviz.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd cyberviz

Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The visualization will start immediately. For the best experience, it is recommended to use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's "Live Server").

ðŸ“‚ File Structure
The project is organized into four main files:

/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # The main HTML file for the website structure and layout.
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css           # Contains all the styling, colors, and layout rules.
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # The core JavaScript logic for the map, simulation, charts, and all interactivity.
â””â”€â”€ particles-config.js # The configuration file for the Particles.js background animation.
